# Hass-consult-predictions
Tasked with studying the factors that affect housing prices using given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months and later on create a model that would allow Hass consulting to accurately predict the prices of homes given predictor variables.
This project will be deemed successful if we can show the influence of the different factors on the housing prices and create a model that can predict the prices as accurately as possible.

# Technologies Used
Being a modelling project, the project required performing various regression algorithms in modelling and getting predictions for house prices. 
We will use various libraries to work on our notebook.

# Support and contact details
In case of any querries, corrections or additions, feel free to reach me and share. Corrections are most welcome since I have just begun the journey and being pointed in the right direction would actually go a long way in helping me grow and learn and become a better data scientist. The goal of data is insight and if you find insight that I didn't, do let me know.
